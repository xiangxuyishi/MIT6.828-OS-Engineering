# MIT6.828-OS-Engineering

## Introcution
As is known to us all, the operating system is becoming relatively more popular in more and more fields due to its priority. A programmer without any knowledge on OS would just be a engineer not artist. So, understanding the micro-kernel of a OS is important and urgent and thanks to MIT we now have a great platform to work on. 

Now, let's begin.

## How?
on XV6, a unix based small OS, which we will work on.

## When?
16 weeks, two classes each week, exception on holidays.

## What?
6 labs, 19 hws, 2 quizzes.
